The reports regarding the component CO have been extracted from www.luchtmeetnet.nl. In particular, we looked at the max_year_day data (supposedly, the highest level of CO reached in a single day of the year), across a timespan that goes from 2015 to 2021.
The data has been downloaded and then cleaned according to the indications. In the first document, the cells marked with an asterisk indicate that ‘Less than 90% of possible daily values are available’. In the second document, the asterisks have been removed and the measurement points have been added for each observation.
The variable ‘measurement_point’ describes where a set of data has been measured. The variable ‘observation’ attributes a name to every observation. The remaining columns show the data relative to a specific year; the unit of measure used for CO levels is usually ‘parts per million’.
